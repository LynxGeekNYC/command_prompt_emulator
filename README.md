# Fake Command Prompt for Windows
I specifically designed this for Scam Baiting. It is a funny Fake Command Prompt Emulator that does funny stuff when the common commands such as "eventvwr," "treet," "netstat," are rand on the command prompt. At the same time, it also logs the end user IP address when they run the "netstat" command and saved in c:\logs\IPLOG.txt file.

Funny thing about "netstat." When they run netstat, they will get this output and will confuse the crap out of these scammers:

# Before Install
Because of the IP Logger, be sure to run it in the VM with all antivirus disabled. Microsoft Frowns upon such actions. See Screen shot on what happens when you try to run the script.

# Installation
You basically have to replace the actual system32\cmd.exe file with this file but be sure to make backups of the actual cmd file.

# YouTube use
If you plan to use this script for YouTube, I don't mind at all. It's not a requirement, but I would appreciate if you provide credit to me and also share my channel as well.
